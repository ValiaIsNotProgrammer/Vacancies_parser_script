# Vacancies_parser_script
When running, it parses jobs from a specific list of sites, depending on your settings in format "head", "city", "company", "date", "link"

Attention, this code may not work, so the tags described in the parser (Parser.py ) may be irrelevant. The optimal solution would be to manually look at the current tags on pages whose urls can be found in the DEFAULT_URL class variable
